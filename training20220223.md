# AzureML Security Training (Feb 25th 2022)

## Prerequisites
* Don't forget ordering your lunch (most important)
* Azure Subscription (Aashish's subscription is fine) to deploy AzureML
* Install latest AzureCLI and Terraform
    * If you use azure cloud shell, it has both CLI and Terraform. No action required.
    * If you use your own local env, please set up the latest AzureCLI and Terraform.
* Prepare your preferred editor to modify terraform file.

## Provision Your Resoruces using Terraform Template

We use [201 Machine Learning template](https://github.com/Azure/terraform) for workspace setup. Please run the following commands.

```
git clone https://github.com/Azure/terraform

cd terraform/quickstart/201-machine-learning-moderately-secure

code .
```
You can see terraform templates in vscode. Let's tweak variables.tf. You can have default value with default ="hogehoge". Decide your unique name and change variable "name" section.

This time we use the same subscription and we should avoid the address spaces overlap. Decide your unique address spaces for vnet and subnet.

Set default value for dsvm host password. It is not recommended but we do this not to forget your password. Password must have 3 of the following: 1 lower case character, 1 upper case character, 1 number, and 1 special character. The value must be between 12 and 123 characters long.

Then run the following commands.

```
terraform init

terraform plan -out azureml.tfplan

terraform apply azureml.tfplan
```
This is the environement you will have within 10 minutes.

## Learn Basic Terms
**What is an Azure Virtual Network?**: Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure. VNet enables many types of Azure resources, such as Azure Virtual Machines (VM), to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks.

**Why use an Azure Virtual Network?**: Azure virtual network enables Azure resources to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks. Key scenarios that you can accomplish with a virtual network include - communication of Azure resources with the internet, communication between Azure resources, communication with on-premises resources, filtering network traffic, routing network traffic, and integration with Azure services.

**What is an Service Endpoint?**: Virtual Network (VNet) service endpoint provides secure and direct connectivity to Azure services over an optimized route over the Azure backbone network. Endpoints allow you to secure your critical Azure service resources to only your virtual networks. Service Endpoints enables private IP addresses in the VNet to reach the endpoint of an Azure service without needing a public IP address on the VNet.

**What is an Private Endpoint?**: A private endpoint is a network interface that uses a private IP address from your virtual network. This network interface connects you privately and securely to a service that's powered by Azure Private Link. By enabling a private endpoint, you're bringing the service into your virtual network.

**What is an Private Link?**: Azure Private Link enables you to access Azure PaaS Services (for example, Azure Storage and SQL Database) and Azure hosted customer-owned/partner services over a private endpoint in your virtual network.

## Network Isolation Two Personas

We have two typical configurations.

## Confirm Provisioned Configurations

On Azure Portal, let's confirm the network isolation configurations. It is close to the End-to-End private IP setup.

* Check Virtual Network and NSGs
    * Virtual Network and Subnet
    * NSG to control inbound and outbound
* Check Workspace Configurations
    * Workpsace has a Private Endpoint.
    * Public Access is denied.
    * Check what happen if you try to access workspace from your client PC
* Check Storage/KeyVault/ACR configurations
    * All resources have Private Endpoint.
    * Storage needs at least two PEs, one for blob, one for file.
    * "Allow the access from trusted azure services" checkbox
    * Public Access should be denied.


## Access Your Workspace via Jumpbox VM

* Connect to your Jumpbox VM. Go to your VM and go to connection>bastion and select connect with your ID and Password defined in your terraform parameter file.
    * Microsoft policy prohibits using Microsoft Credential on Azure VM. Grant the RG's contributor role for your private email account and use that credential to access azureml workspace.
    * Go to Compute tab and confirm network isolation configurations.
    * Create your compute instance. You cannot use the CI created by template, because you are not using Microsoft Credential.
    * Create a No Public IP compute. You should see errors.
    * Create an AKS cluster behind Vnet. You should see errors.
* Try to run sample notebooks on integrated notebook and Jupyter notebook on CI to train model, deploy model to AKS.

## Advanced Configurations

### Establish point to site VPN connection

See [this step by step guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal). You will have followings.

* Virtual network gateway
* Gateway subnet for Virtual network gateway
* NSG for Gateway subnet
* Public IP addresses for Virtual network gateway

You also need to update your hostfile to resolve workspace FQDNs with private IP. This is [the documentation for custom DNS](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-custom-dns). Actual step and examples are below.

* Open hostfile (Win+R and %SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts)
* Below is my examples
