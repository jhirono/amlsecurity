# AzureML Security Training as of Feb 23rd 2022

## Provision Your Resoruces using Terraform Template

We use [201 Machine Learning template](https://github.com/Azure/terraform) for workspace setup. Please run the following commands.

```
git clone https://github.com/Azure/terraform

cd terraform/quickstart/201-machine-learning-moderately-secure

code .
```
You can see terraform templates in vscode. Let's tweak variables.tf. You can have default value with default ="hogehoge". Decide your unique name and change variable "name" section.

This time we use the same subscription and we should avoid the address spaces overlap. Decide your unique address spaces for vnet and subnet.

Set default value for dsvm host password. It is not recommended but we do this not to forget your password. Password must have 3 of the following: 1 lower case character, 1 upper case character, 1 number, and 1 special character. The value must be between 12 and 123 characters long.

Then run the following commands.

```
terraform init

terraform plan -out azureml.tfplan

terraform apply azureml.tfplan
```
This is the environement you will have within 10 minutes.

## Network Isolation Two Personas

We have two typical configurations.

## Confirm Provisioned Configurations

On Azure Portal, let's confirm the network isolation configurations. It is close to the End-to-End private IP setup.

* Check Virtual Network and NSGs
    * Virtual Network and Subnet
    * NSG to control inbound and outbound
* Check Workspace Configurations
    * Workpsace has a Private Endpoint.
    * Public Access is denied.
    * Check what happen if you try to access workspace from your client PC
* Check Storage/KeyVault/ACR configurations
    * All resources have Private Endpoint.
    * Storage needs at least two PEs, one for blob, one for file.
    * "Allow the access from trusted azure services" checkbox
    * Public Access should be denied.


## Access Your Workspace via Jumpbox VM

* Connect to your Jumpbox VM. Go to your VM and go to connection>bastion and select connect with your ID and Password defined in your terraform parameter file.
    * Microsoft policy prohibits using Microsoft Credential on Azure VM. Grant the RG's contributor role for your private email account and use that credential to access azureml workspace.
    * Go to Compute tab and confirm network isolation configurations.
    * Create your compute instance. You cannot use the CI created by template, because you are not using Microsoft Credential.
    * Create a No Public IP compute. You should see errors.
    * Create an AKS cluster behind Vnet. You should see errors.
* Try to run sample notebooks on integrated notebook and Jupyter notebook on CI to train model, deploy model to AKS.

## Advanced Configurations

### Establish point to site VPN connection

See [this step by step guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal). You will have followings.

* Virtual network gateway
* Gateway subnet for Virtual network gateway
* NSG for Gateway subnet
* Public IP addresses for Virtual network gateway

You also need to update your hostfile to resolve workspace FQDNs with private IP. This is [the documentation for custom DNS](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-custom-dns). Actual step and examples are below.

* Open hostfile (Win+R and %SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts)
* Below is my examples
